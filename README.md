rhttp
=====

*rhttp* is a small, incomplete HTTP server that can serve a remote directory,
accessible via *ssh*, on the local host, or vice versa.  On both the local and
the remote host *python3* should be installed.  There is no need to install
*rhttp* in the remote host though.  Run `rhttp --help` for an explanation of
the command line arguments.
